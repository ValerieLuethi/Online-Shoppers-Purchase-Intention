# Online-Shoppers-Purchase-Intention

The e-commerce industry has grown rapidly over the past years, yet conversion rates are not increasing as much. To address this gap, online retailers are looking for solutions to present online shoppers with personalized promotions. Whereas physical retail relies on their salespeople’s knowledge and experience to realize successful sales, online retail makes use of machine learning to detect and predict customers behavior patterns (Sakar et al., 2019).
The goal of this project was to predict whether a visitor of an online shopping website will complete a purchase or exit the website without purchasing anything. Different machine learning models were applied and evaluated.

The data set used in this project was initially collected by Sakar et al. (2019) for their real-time online shopper behavior analysis system to predict visitor’s shopping intent and likelihood of website abandonment. It is made available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Sakar & Kastro, 2018).

This project was created by three students as part of the course "Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling" at Hochschule Luzern (HSLU) in the spring semester 2025.
